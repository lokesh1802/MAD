## Summary and Reflection



For this MP, I focused on ensuring the app's user experience was seamless, from login to gameplay. A significant implementation decision was designing a robust session management system that ensured token validation and secure handling of user sessions. 



This MP was both challenging and rewarding. I particularly enjoyed creating the dynamic game board and ensuring that the app remained responsive and intuitive.
