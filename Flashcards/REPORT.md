## Summary and Reflection

I have used multiple views and multiple widgets which helped me organize the code.
everthing regarding deck view is stored in the deck_list_page.dart and and everthing regarding cards view is stored in the card_list_page.dart i have used json_loader to load the data from json file. 

I learned a lot while building the flaskcards application. I faced many challenges while implementing some functionalities like download button and updating deck which took lot of time and in this process i have learned a lot. I enjoyed a lot while working on this application.
